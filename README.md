# -Smart-Agriculture-Management-System-
AgriSmart is an integrated management system developed using Java (NetBeans IDE) and MySQL database technology. The project features dedicated interfaces for Administrators to manage crop inventories and Customers to place orders. A key highlight is the seamless integration of JasperReports, which captures real-time transaction data (Date, Time, Total) to generate automated, professional receipts. By bridging the gap between farmers and consumers, AgriSmart ensures transparent, data-driven, and efficient agricultural commerce.
